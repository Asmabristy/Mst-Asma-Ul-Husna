# Mst-Asma-Ul-Husna
I’m a Software Engineering student at Macquarie University (graduating 2027) with a strong foundation in Java, Python, and C. My interests span software systems, distributed computing, and AI models, and I enjoy building projects that connect theory with real-world applications.
I’ve worked on projects ranging from a smart bridge traffic-light and control system (ESP32, sensors, UI) to a domain-specific programming language for river flow modelling. I also bring experience in algorithms, system programming, and teamwork through both coursework and extracurricular projects.
Beyond coding, I’m passionate about teaching, mentoring, and continuous learning, always exploring new frameworks and tools to broaden my skill set.
